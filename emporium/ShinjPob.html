        After his mother's death, he was abandoned by his father and lived for 11 years with his sensei,
        until he was summoned to Tokyo-3 to pilot <strong>Unit-01</strong> against the Angels. Though he start off alone, <em>Shinji</em>
        grows closer to those around him and learns to love himself.
